## Price Increase Objection

**Purpose:** Challenge unilateral price increase with contractual references and establish negotiation process. Prevents acceptance of unexpected price escalations.

**Subject Line:** Price Increase Objection – [SERVICE NAME] – Effective [PROPOSED DATE]

**Body:**

Dear [VENDOR ACCOUNT MANAGER],

[ORGANIZATION NAME] is formally objecting to the price increase for [SERVICE NAME] effective [PROPOSED EFFECTIVE DATE] announced [DATE ANNOUNCED].

**Price Increase Details:**
- **Current Annual Cost:** [CURRENT AMOUNT]
- **Proposed New Annual Cost:** [NEW AMOUNT]
- **Increase Percentage:** [X%]
- **Proposed Effective Date:** [DATE]
- **Notice Period Provided:** [X days/months]

**Contractual Analysis:**

Our Service Agreement Section [X] [choose applicable basis]:

**OPTION A – Price Escalation Limited by Contract:**
"Pricing increases shall not exceed [X%] annually." The proposed increase of [X%] exceeds the contractual maximum of [X%]. We do not accept an increase beyond the contractual limit without modification to the Service Agreement.

**OPTION B – Price Increase Requires Mutual Agreement:**
"Pricing modifications require written agreement of both parties." No such agreement has been executed. The proposed increase is unilateral and not binding on [ORGANIZATION NAME].

**OPTION C – Price Locked During Initial Term:**
"Pricing for the initial term shall remain fixed." We are currently in the initial contract term ending [DATE]. This unilateral increase violates the pricing lock provision.

**OPTION D – Increase Requires Justification:**
Section [X] requires that any proposed pricing increase be supported by [specified justification – e.g., "inflation index," "usage increase documentation," "enhanced service delivery"]. The increase announcement did not provide this justification.

**Our Position:**

We accept the following pricing adjustments:
- [Annual CPI/inflation adjustment if contractually permitted] – [PROPOSED AMOUNT]
- Usage-based increases only for documented consumption above [BASELINE] – [PROPOSED AMOUNT]
- No unilateral increase beyond these justified amounts

**Required Actions:**

We require [VENDOR] to take one of the following actions by [DATE – typically 30 days]:

1. **Withdraw the price increase** for current customers and maintain pricing at current levels through the end of the contract term [EXPIRATION DATE]

2. **Justify the increase** with documentation showing [specific justification – e.g., "inflation costs," "increased capacity required for our usage," "service enhancements delivered"], and we will negotiate a reasonable adjustment

3. **Limit the increase** to [X%] annually per our contractual term, with the balance deferred to the next contract renewal

**Alternative – Renewal Term Pricing:**

If this price increase is associated with renewal, we can discuss modification of pricing for the renewal term through the formal renewal process. However, mid-contract price increases during the current term are not acceptable without contractual basis and mutual agreement.

**Business Relationship Impact:**

Price increases that violate our contractual terms or are imposed unilaterally without justification create risk in our relationship. We have valued our partnership with [VENDOR], but we must ensure vendor contracts include appropriate price protection. If [VENDOR] is unable to honor pricing commitments, we must evaluate alternative vendors.

Please contact [YOUR NAME] to discuss this issue and reach agreement on appropriate pricing adjustments.

Regards,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR TITLE]
[ORGANIZATION NAME]

CC: [Your Procurement Lead], [Your Finance Lead]

**Tone Guidance:**
- First price increase challenge: Professional and fact-based. Cite specific contractual provision. Assume increase was unintentional.
- Repeated price increases without justification: More firm. Signal that relationship is at risk and alternatives are being evaluated.
- Price increase beyond contractual limit: Direct and formal. Signal non-compliance and potential termination.

**Legal References:**
- Pricing escalation clause: Section [X] of Service Agreement
- CPI adjustment (if applicable): Section [X] of Service Agreement
- Usage-based pricing (if applicable): Section [X] of Service Agreement
- Unilateral modification prohibition: General contract law principle and Section [X] if explicitly stated

**Follow-up Timeline:**
- Day 15: If no response, escalate to vendor financial contact
- Day 30: Final response required; if unacceptable, notify of termination intent
- Day 45: If increase imposed despite objection, begin exit process
- Option: Escalate to vendor executive board if relationship is strategic
